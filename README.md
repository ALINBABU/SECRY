# SECRY
Secure Cloud Storage using Hybrid Cryptography

Final year B.tech Project 


Secry is a webapp that stores text files in secure cloud storage using hybrid cryptography.It also uses image steganography to store the cryptography key.


About

   Cloud computing has now become a major trend, it is a new data hosting technology that is very popular in recent years. In this project, we are developing an web application that can securely store the files to a cloud server. We proposes a system that uses hybrid cryptography technique to securely store the data in cloud. The hybrid approach when deployed in cloud environment makes the remote server more secure and thus, helps the users to fetch more trust of their data in the cloud. For data security and privacy protection issues, the fundamental challenge of separation of sensitive data and access control is fulfilled. Cryptography technique translates original data into unreadable format. This technique uses keys for translate data into unreadable form. So only authorized person can access data from cloud server.

   We provide a cloud storage that uses multiple crypotraphic technique whichis known by hybrid cryptography. The product provides confidentiality by using security for both upload and download. The data will be secured since we use multi level security techniques and multiple servers for storage.
